            Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG),[4] trading as BMW Group (commonly abbreviated to BMW (German pronunciation: [ˌbeːʔɛmˈveː] ⓘ), sometimes anglicised as Bavarian Motor Works), is a German multinational conglomerate manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Germany. The moniker, "BMW ", first came into use when the German firm Rapp Motorenwerke changed its name to Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH (BMW GmbH) in 1917. Thereafter, in 1922, the name and assets of BMW GmbH were transferred to the aircraft manufacturer Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG (formerly Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik), thereby giving rise to the company known today as BMW AG.[5][6]

            BMW AG's automobiles are marketed under the BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce brands while its motorcycles are marketed under the BMW Motorrad brand. In 2023, BMW became the world's ninth-largest producer of motor vehicles (with 2,555,341 vehicles made in that year alone)[7] as well as the 6th largest automaker by revenue.[8] In 2023, it was ranked 46th in the Forbes Global 2000.[9] The company also has significant motor-sport history, especially in touring cars, sports cars, and the Isle of Man TT. BMW initially focused on aircraft engine production during World War I, a legacy that influenced the company’s engineering emphasis on performance and precision. Following postwar restrictions on aircraft manufacturing, BMW diversified into motorcycle production in the 1920s and later entered the automobile market, establishing itself as a major player in the automotive industry.

            BMW AG is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, and China.[10] The Quandt family [de] is a long-term shareholder of the company, following investments by the brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt in 1959 which saved BMW from bankruptcy, with remaining shares owned by the public.
