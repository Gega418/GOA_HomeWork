        <p><b>Crocodiles are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. They tend to congregate in freshwater habitats like rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water. Crocodiles are ambush predators, waiting for fish or land animals to come close, then rushing out to attack.</b></p>

        <p><b>Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica. The group is paraphyletic as it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia; some lizards are more closely related to these two groups than they are to other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo dragon.</b></p>
